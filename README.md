# js-password-generator

## Description

- To showcase my knowledge and skillset with Javascript I was tasked with developing functions for a password generator that would generate a new random password every time the "generate password" button was clicked.

- I was able to recall basic javascript data types to create and declare new variables to use in my JavaScript functions and use psuedocoding to outline the structure of my code.

- Using arrays I created lists of approved characters for my password generator to use to create the new random  password.

- using the confirm and alert methods, I was able to effectively prompt the user to choose the length of their new random password and what types of characters they wanted to include in the password.

- I created a "for" loop using object methods to help choose chracters at random for the user to include in their new random password. 

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN I need a new, secure password
- WHEN I click the button to generate a password
- THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
- WHEN prompted for password criteria
- THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
- WHEN prompted for the length of the password
- THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
- THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- WHEN I answer each prompt
- THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
- WHEN all prompts are answered
- THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
- WHEN the password is generated
- THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
